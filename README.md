# Jellyfish
***Build presenters as declarative state machines with Compose***

Heavily inspired by [Square's Workflow library](https://square.github.io/workflow/), Jellyfish has some core properties:
- Presenters are declaratively defined state-machines
- Separation of internal presenter state and UI models
- Allows starting of a presenter in any given state, which makes testing nice and easy
- Supports nested composition of presenters

 Jellyfish is production ready and has been used in the OpenSea Android and iOS apps (via Kotlin Multiplatform) for over a year.
